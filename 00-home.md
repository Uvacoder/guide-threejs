# THREE.JS - TUTORIAL 

## Home

[Three.js](https://threejs.org) is an open-source JavaScript library that you can use to create amazing, dynamic, and interactive websites with 2D and 3D graphics. With Three.js you can render 3D graphics directly inside the browser. You can do amazing stuff using Three.js and JavaScript, by adding animations or some logic and even turn your website into a game. Three.js was released by Ricardo Cabello in April 2010 and is maintained by a great open-source community.

## Audience 

This tutorial is for anyone who already knows JavaScript and wants to start with creating 3D graphics that run in any browser. This tutorial is intended to make you comfortable in getting started with [Three.js](https://threejs.org) and [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API).

## Prerequisites

Creating 3D applications that run in a browser falls at the intersection of web development and computer graphics. You donâ€™t need to know anything about computer graphics or advanced math; all that is needed is a general understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you are just getting started with JavaScript, I recommend completing this [tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/index.htm) before proceeding with this one.
